technology can be used to analyze the patient's symptoms, obtain accurate diagnostic results, and
enhance the process of medical diagnosis and treatment by collecting a large amount of patient data.
Because of the constraints of customary clinical ideas, a few patients are as yet incredulous about the
demonstrative finishes of computers. People need to be aware of the fact that the development of
computer AI technology will unavoidably alter the manner in which the medical staff works, and they
need to be willing to accept the new changes brought about by this technology in order to improve the
overall level of medicine [10].
4.3. Application in the field of scientific research
Since the wise innovation of computer has strong sensible reasoning, the utilization of this innovation
in logical examination can speed up the advancement of related research, work on the speed of change,
and produce tremendous financial advantages. The use of computer AI technology enables in-depth
problem analysis and the development of practical solutions for the use of scientific researchers. The
development of the database is closely linked to the computer's capacity for logical reasoning. Making
full use of the data in the database can help the computer analyze the problem more effectively and
identify the problem's automatic generation. The use of computer-based artificial intelligence
technology in scientific research has the potential to speed up problem processing and boost research
efficiency.
4.4. Application in the field of problem solving
